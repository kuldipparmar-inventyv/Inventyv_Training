# JavaScript Tasks
This folder contains JavaScript tasks completed during my software development training at **Inventyv**.

### 01_array_promise_problem.js
**What it does:** This script passes data between two functions, merges arrays using the spread operator, and uses a Promise to validate if the total sum of elements is greater than 35.

**Key takeaway:** I practiced managing data flow with `shift()` and `push()` .

### 02_numerical_pattern.js
**What it does:** Generates a nested coordinate-based number pattern using loops. To make it challenging, I avoided static addition and used bit manipulation .

**Key takeaway:** This task deepened my understanding of Two's Complement and how to manipulate integers at the bit level to achieve standard arithmetic results without basic operators. And also logicl thinking increased .

### 03_array_promise_problem_with_symbols.js
**What it does:** This is a refactor of the initial array task that uses `Symbol` identifiers instead of standard string keys. It stores the array data within objects indexed by these unique symbols to prevent property name collisions.

**Key takeaway:** I learned how to implement computed property names and use Symbols to create more secure and encapsulated object structures.
